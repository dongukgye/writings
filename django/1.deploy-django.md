### #0 Introduction

In this article, we are going to talk about how to deploy Django project with postgresql, gunicorn and nginx. 


### #1 Install packages

First of all, install all packages we're going to use with following command.

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev libpq-dev postgresql postgresql-contrib nginx -y
```

### #2 Setup Database

After the installation, first thing we need to do is start up the database server(in case of the database server doesn't automatically start up), and access to the posgres prompt to create a database and user for our django project.

```shell
db setting
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE db_name;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# CREATE USER admin WITH PASSWORD 'password';
CREATE ROLE
postgres=# ALTER ROLE admin SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
ALTER ROLE
postgres=# ALTER ROLE admin SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
ALTER ROLE
postgres=# ALTER ROLE admin SET timezone TO 'UST';
ALTER ROLE
postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE db_name TO admin;
GRANT
postgres=# \q
```

### #3 Setup Python environment

I prefer to use `virtualenvwrapper` to manage my python virtualenvs, it easy to use and manage than the original python virtualenv program. 

```shell
$ pip3 install virtualenvwrapper
```

And then, we need to add following lines to the .bashrc(or the rc file for whatever shell you use) file, feel free to change the paths if needed.

```shell
# virtualenvwrapper settings
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_VIRTUALENV=$HOME/.local/bin/virtualenv
source $HOME/.local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```

Source the .bashrc file or restart your shell. Now we can simply run following commands to create a virtualenv.
```shell
$ mkvirtualenv env
```
And activate. 
```shell
$ workon env
```

### #4 Setup Django project

I think we are not going to talk too much detail about how to initiate a Django project, I assume you already have a ready-to-deply Django project, and we'll focus on how to create different setting modules for production and debug.

Now, you have only one setting file which is `my_project/my_project/settings.py`, and we need to change the structure of the setting modules as follows.

Run following commands in the root directory of your Django project.
```shell
$ cd my_project # cd into the directory of settings.py file
$ mkdir settings # make a new directory for setting modules
$ mv settings.py settings/debug.py # move settings.py to settings directory and rename it to debug.py
$ cp settings/debug.py settings/production.py # copy debug.py to production.py
```

Now, we have two separate setting modules, and the structure of the setting modules is as follows.

```shell
my_project/my_project/settings/debug.py
my_project/my_project/settings/production.py
```

We'll leave the debug.py as the current state, and focus only on the production.py. 

First, and the most important setting we need to change is `DEBUG` option, Django set the `DEBUG` option to `True` by default, we need to change it to `False` in production mode as mentioned in the [Django Official Document.](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/settings/#std:setting-DEBUG)

And also read the `SECRET_KEY` from env vaviable instead of hardcode into setting file.
```Python
SECRET_KEY = os.environ['DJANGO_SECRET_KEY']
```

Next, setup the database.
```Python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'db_name',
        'USER': 'admin',
        'PASSWORD': 'password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': 5432
    }
}
```

Since we've changed the path of the setting modules, we also need to change the references to the setting modules. By default, setting module is referenced in two places, `manage.py` and `wsgi.py`.

```Python
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'smartinventory.settings')
```

The code simply checks that if the system env variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is exists, if it doesn't, set it to `smartinventory.settings` which is the path of default setting module, and here we need to change the path to `smartinventory.settings.debug`, this allows us to still use the debug settings module when developing.

And yes, if we set `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` env variable to `smartinventory.settings.production` in our live server, Django will read the productin setting module as default.

### #5 Setup gunicorn

Install gunicorn with pip.
```shell
$ pip install gunicorn
```

And create a gunicorn service file.
```
/etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service
```
Paste in following content.
```
[Unit]
Description=gunicorn daemon
After=network.target

[Service]
User=username
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/django/project/root/directory
EnvironmentFile=/path/to/envs/file
ExecStart=/home/username/.virtualenvs/env/bin/gunicorn --access-logfile - --workers 3 --bind unix:/path/to/django/project/root/directory/gunicorn.sock my_project.wsgi:application

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Note that the `EnvironmentFile=/path/to/envs/file` option, somehow, gunicorn can't read the system env variables properly in my ubuntu server, so the fix for this is to create a file containing the env variables and set the `EnvironmentFile` option in gunicorn service file, and the content of the envs file are as follows.
```
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE='smartinventory.settings.production'
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY='txx*zi!vuqgutvg=@2-drm12+erws*e304_baqkb*y*fnu$@82'
```

Start and enable gunicorn service.
```
$ sudo systemctl start gunicorn
$ sudo systemctl enable gunicorn
```

### #6 Setup nginx

Since we've bind our Django project to a unix socket with gunicorn, the only thing we need to do with nginx is to set a proxy to the unix socket. 

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    location /static/ {
        root /path/to/django/project/root/directory;
    }

    location / {
        include proxy_params;
        proxy_pass http://unix:/path/to/django/project/root/directory/gunicorn.sock;
    }
}
```

Last, restart the nginx service.
```shell
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

That's it, now type the domain name(or IP) in your browser, you should see the index page of your Django project.
congratulations! :\
